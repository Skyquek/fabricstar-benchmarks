test:
  name: fixed-asset-levelDB
  description: This is a duration based benchmark targeting a Hyperledger Fabric network with a LevelDB world state database using the `fixed-asset` NodeJS chaincode contract that is interacted with via 
    a Fabric-SDK-Node Gateway. Each test round flexes a single chaincode method, and includes a null-operation to act as a performance cost baseline.

  rounds:
  - label: empty-contract-evaluate
    description: Test an evaluateTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `nullResponse`, which immediately returns a null response. This represents the fastest possible round trip time for an evaluateTransaction() method.

  - label: empty-contract-submit
    description: Test a submitTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `nullResponse`, which immediately returns a null response. This represents the fastest possible round trip time for a submitTransaction() method.

    description: Test a submitTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `create`, which inserts an Asset of size 1000 bytes into the World State database.

    description: Test a evaluateTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `getAsset`. This method performs a `getState()` operation for a passed UUID, retrieving as asset of size 1000 bytes.

    description: Test a submitTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `getAsset`. This method performs a `getState()` operation for a passed UUID, retrieving as asset of size 1000 bytes. This test includes involvement of the orderer, and appending to the ledger.
