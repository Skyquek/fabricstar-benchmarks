    This is a duration based benchmark targeting a Hyperledger Fabric network
    using the `fixed-asset` NodeJS chaincode
    contract that is interacted with via a Fabric-SDK-Node Gateway. Each test
    round flexes the `emptyContract` method. Rounds run for evaluate and submit
    Gateway routes.

        Test an evaluateTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS
        `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `emptyContract`, which
        immediately returns a null response. This represents the fastest
        possible round trip time for an evaluateTransaction() method that does
        not touch the world state or perform any action.
