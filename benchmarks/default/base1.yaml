  description: >-
    This is a duration based benchmark targeting a Hyperledger Fabric network
    using the `fixed-asset` NodeJS chaincode
    contract that is interacted with via a Fabric-SDK-Node Gateway. Each test
    round flexes a single chaincode method, and includes a null-operation to act
    as a performance cost baseline.

        Test a submitTransaction() Gateway method against the NodeJS
        `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `create`, which performs a
        `putState()` operation on an asset of size 25 bytes.
